My name is Slice, I've been coding since the start of 2020 with Discord bots.
Since starting I've branched out to a wide range of areas through multiple projects.
I hope to give you some insight into my development journey on this website here and share some cool findings.

## Skills
### Discord Bots
Discord bots is how I really got into coding and I still maintain multiple bots right now.
These bots have all been written in JavaScript (nodejs) with [discord.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js).

### Website Backend Development
I've spent quite a lot of time on website backends making things functional and keeping them secure.
Most of my website backend experience is in PHP with the [Laravel framework](https://laravel.com/).

### Unity Modding
At the start of 2024 I attempted modding Lethal Company which taught me a lot about Unity, C# and Unity game modding.
At the end of 2024 the horror game MiSide was released for which I made a [mod to help speedrunners](https://github.com/SliceCraft/MiSideSpeedrunMod/).
This game is compiled with IL2CPP which causes some extra complexity when modding.

### Minecraft Plugins
I've made a few private Minecraft Java plugins mostly focussed on implementing minigames.
Although most of these projects were very ambitious and were never fully released I'm still very happy with some of the work I did on those projects.
While implementing these plugins I learned a bunch about programming concepts and worked on some implementation that I'm still proud of to this day.
