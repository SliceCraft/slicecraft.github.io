So, I randomly decided this week that I'm going to post a weekly progress update about the things I've been working on.
If you're curious to the things I'm working on and how things are going, then come back here every week to see some cool updates.

# Caturra Launch
![Initial commit being made nearly a year ago](/images/2025/10/12/CaturraInitCommit.png)  
After about a year of development which was way longer then AFuxy and I were expecting we finally released Caturra.
Caturra is a platform that provides an API for people to build a social media website without us forcing you to use a specific frontend.
If you have any frontend and design skills, make sure to check out the platform at https://caturra.app and the documentation at https://docs.caturra.social/

We've had an alpha version available for a few months for people to test with, so I was already fairly familiar with the deployment process.
This meant that the deployment process went pretty smooth.
Apart from a missed configuration change and a hiccup with Let's encrypt there were no issues preparing the launch.
We made use of the Laravel maintenance mode to be able to double-check everything before launch.
Everything seemed fine and last Tuesday we pulled the trigger to make Caturra available for everyone.

# Miquel's frontend changes
[MiquelVZLA](https://github.com/MiquelVZLA) offered to make some frontend changes to the [TUYU xp leaderboard site](https://tuyu.slicegames.nl) to do some more practice and this was definitely needed for the site since the site has looked quite bad.
See the below screenshot for how the site looked previously.

The changes Miquel made have made the website look a lot better so thanks a lot for offering to do this!
While preparing the repository so Miquel could work on the frontend, I did realise that some of my data parsing logic seems to be causing some problems.
This parsing fix and the first part of the frontend redesign are already available on the [website](https://tuyu.slicegames.nl).
I still have to figure out some deployment steps for the rest of the frontend changes to be released since there has been quite a major overhaul.
More on that when the site has been updated.

## Preview
I can show you some preview images of how the website will look in the future. Hopefully I'll be able to deploy this next week.

# Quick fire changes
- The not so amazing people at Mee6 have made a lot of features paid including a feature where a message is sent in a channel when a member leaves the server. This is such a simple feature to implement that I just [made it myself](https://github.com/SliceCraft/TUYUcordBot/pull/35) and that is working as a good replacement now.
- Fixed an issue in the [TUYU discord server](https://discord.gg/tuyu) where tickets couldn't be created. A temporary fix for now but it'll do until I figure out a proper solution.
- Fixed an issue where our Laravel Nightwatch usage would be drained by logging a command that is used to check if the docker containers are still running.
- Discussed with the other Trinity developers about how we want to continue running Trinity in the future. There's still an issue for us to resolve but after that I expect us to be moving at a good pace. More information on this will follow soon.
