Happy New Year everyone!! 🎉🎉

Last year has been a rollercoaster of emotions with a lot of amazing moments and also a lot of bad moments.
Hopefully 2026 will be a year filled with a lot of happy and amazing moments.

In terms of the development I have done the past year has been amazing.
I've progressed a lot in my coding abilities and learned a bunch of things about hosting and maintaining the infrastructure for Trinity and Caturra.

# Trinity
Trinity has been mostly silent the past year.
We've been at work performing security updates and adding bug fixes but we haven't really added anything new in the past year.
I've also performed some infrastructure improvements like improving our backup strategy.
We should be able to recover from disasters more quickly now and with less to no data loss while the previous process could mean a day of data being lost.
We still use that backup strategy as an additional backup just to be sure though.

There are some projects that we're working on that I can't wait to show everyone.
More information about that later this year but I can assure you that there are some massive things planned!

# Caturra
Meanwhile Caturra went from being mostly an idea to the functional site that we have today.
Below you can see a picture of how caturra looked one year ago today.

None of those buttons were actually functioning.
A lot of tabs and pages were missing in the frontend at this point and none of the backend had been implemented.
All we had was register, email verification and login at this point, we've come a long way this year with Caturra.

Next year we'll surely be adding lots more features to Caturra that will be announced in the future.
For now if you want to see what we're working on you can head over to [our cutting edge website](https://dev.caturra.app) and test what we're developing.

# Final thoughts
A lot has happened this year, a lot of progress has been made in the past year and I hope next year will be a productive year too.
I can't wait to show everyone our plans and I wish everyone an amazing 2026!
